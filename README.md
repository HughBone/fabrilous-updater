# Fabrilous Updater
Minecraft server-side (works in singleplayer!) mod used to check for updates to your Fabric mods.

Note: Only works with mods on CurseForge and Modrinth.

## Commands:

## How it works:

Using the magic of file hashes, Fabrilous Updater searches through Curseforge and Modrinth to find the latest compatible mod version.
