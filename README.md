# This PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED

Dawg I'm trying to get my curseforge vbucks here, this project kinda prevents you from seeing the ads

If anyone wants to update this project, the source code is available. I give you permission to do whatever you want with it

## Fabrilous Updater
Minecraft server-side (works in singleplayer!) mod used to check for updates to your Fabric mods.

Note: Only works with mods uploaded to CurseForge or Modrinth.


## Commands
* "/fabdate update" - Shows a list of mods needing updates with a clickable download link.
* "/fabdate ignore"  -  Add, list, or remove mods from an ignore list to prevent update checks.
* "/fabdate autoupdate" - Automatically removes old mods and downloads new mods.


## How it works:
Using the magic of file hashes, Fabrilous Updater searches through Curseforge and Modrinth to find the latest compatible version.
