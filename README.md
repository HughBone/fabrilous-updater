# Fabrilous Updater
Minecraft server-side (works in singleplayer!) mod used to check for updates to your Fabric mods.

## How to use?

Place the mod in your mods folder and make sure you run it once. Then, open the "fabrilousupdater.txt" file found in your config folder. Open the CurseForge page for the mod you want to check for updates. Copy the mod's Project ID and paste it into "fabrilousupdater.txt" one line at a time (See photos). That's it!

## Commands
